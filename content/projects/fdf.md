FDF, short for "Fil de Fer" (french for "wireframe"), is a school project from [42](https://42.fr/). This project focuses on rendering 3D wireframe representations of maps, pushing the boundaries of programming in C. Utilizing the [minilibx](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux) library, FDF showcases Bresenham's line algorithm.
