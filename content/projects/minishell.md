title: Minishell - Emulating Unix Shell Behavior
description: Minishell, a challenging project from school 42, showcases my software development capabilities by replicating the complex functionalities of the traditional Unix shell, bash. This project emphasizes meticulous error handling, signal processing, and command execution, underlining the project's importance and complexity in the 42 school curriculum.

Minishell, a cornerstone project at [42](https://42.fr/), tasked us with reproducing the nuanced behavior of bash, the Unix shell known for its command-line interface facilitating direct interaction with the operating system.

> A shell in Unix is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system by typing commands. It acts as an intermediary between the user and the kernel, executing user commands and providing output or feedback.

This project, distinguished as **one of the curriculum's most intricate challenges**, demanded an in-depth understanding and implementation of command interpretation, signal processing, and error messaging. My involvement highlighted my adaptability and technical prowess in full-stack development, particularly in creating a command interpreter that's both precise and user-friendly, echoing bash's exceptional error feedback and command execution fidelity.
