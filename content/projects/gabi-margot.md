Gabi & Margot represents my foray into building comprehensive e-commerce solutions as a full-stack developer. This project, focusing on unique vintage furniture, not only involved frontend theme design but also deep integration with Shopify's API using the Hydrogen framework.
Although the project was abandoned, it paved the way for a new project called [Storedge](/projects/storedge), which focuses on other e-commerce innovations
